## 🎯 Key Insights for 2025

> AI agents have evolved from “chat over dashboards” to **actionable co-workers** spanning the entire incident lifecycle.

🏆 **Top Takeaways**
- **Composable adoption** wins — no single vendor covers all needs  
- **Human-in-the-loop** is now standard for trust and compliance  
- **AgentOps maturity** defines production readiness (observability, safety, and evaluation)  
- **IaC as the safety rail** — Infrastructure-as-Code remains the guardrail for automation with approvals
