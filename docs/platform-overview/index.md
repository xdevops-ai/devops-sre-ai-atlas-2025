# 🧩 Capability Explanations — Exhaustive Guide

This section defines each Atlas capability with **clear boundaries**, **what counts / does not count**, **evidence you should collect**, and a **scoring rubric** for Y / P / N with maturity (Low/Medium/High). Use it to evaluate vendors consistently and to avoid ambiguity during bake‑offs.

> **How to use:** For each capability, validate with artifacts (screenshots, API outputs, logs, PRs, dashboards) and mark the **highest level that is fully satisfied**. When in doubt, choose the **lower** level and add a note.

## Executive Summary -- DevOps & SRE AI Platforms (Jan 6, 2026)

**The headline:** AI agents for DevOps/SRE have progressed from "chat over dashboards" to actionable co‑workers spanning triage → RCA → guided remediation → post‑incident learning. No single vendor covers the full lifecycle; the 2025 winning pattern is composable adoption: anchor on an observability‑first triage brain, add a workflow orchestrator for approvals/audit, and layer in guardrailed provisioning for safe apply/rollback.

### Market map at a glance

| Archetype | Best fit | Representative platforms | Core strength | Typical limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observability‑First | Fast triage, RCA, incident comms | Dynatrace Davis AI; Cisco (Splunk) AI Agents; Datadog Bits AI & Agents; Elastic AI Assistant; New Relic AI; **BigPanda**; **BMC Helix AIOps**; **LogicMonitor AIOps**; **Moogsoft** | Multi‑signal correlation, causal/hypothesis reasoning, narrative updates | Usually no direct apply beyond playbooks; relies on external approvals |
| Provisioning‑Focused | Safe, repeatable infra changes | Azure Copilot (Agent Mode); DuploCloud; Qovery; Kuberns; **HashiCorp Terraform MCP + Infragraph** | Generate/apply IaC with approvals and rollback | Lighter AIOps correlation; observability via integrations |
| Developer‑Centric & Frameworks | Code/PR changes; build your own agents | AWS Strands SDK; Atlassian Rovo Dev; GitHub Copilot Coding Agent; Zencoder; JFrog Fly; Azure AI Agent Service (Foundry); **GitLab Duo Agent Platform** | Planning/tool orchestration, CI/CD fixes, AgentOps | Not a runtime ops console; direct infra apply limited |
| Enterprise Orchestrators | Cross‑team workflows, audit, CMDB | ServiceNow AI Agent Orchestrator; Salesforce Agentforce (OpsAI); PagerDuty AIOps; **Rootly**; **xMatters**; **Kubiya** | Ticket/change graph, approvals, runbooks | Deep telemetry depends on observability tools |
| Data & MLOps | AI quality, data pipelines | Databricks Agent Bricks; Snowflake Cortex Agents; Dataiku AI Agents; **Observe (o11y.ai)** | Evaluations/guardrails, lineage, model operations | Infra ops out of scope |
| Specialized Domain | Deep expertise for a niche | IBM AskIAM (IAM); Solo.io Kagent (K8s); **Snyk**; **incident.io**; **Overmind**; **Harness AIDA**; **Dell APEX AIOps** | Accuracy within narrow scope | Limited breadth by design |

### Top 6 takeaways for 2025
1. **From chat to action:** Leaders pair **explanations with verifiable evidence** (queries/logs/traces) and **suggest the next safe step** (runbook, PR, or controlled apply).  
2. **Human‑in‑the‑loop is default:** Approvals, RBAC, and audit trails are table stakes for production change.  
3. **AgentOps matters:** Tracing, evaluations, and policy hooks (data boundaries, PII controls, prompt safety) separate pilots from production.  
4. **Event ontology wins RCA:** Platforms with **typed entities + change context** consistently outperform generic LLMs on root cause.  
5. **IaC is the safety rail:** Even where agents can apply changes, **diffs/Bicep/Terraform + approvals** remain the safest path.  
6. **Compose the stack:** The best outcomes pair **one observability brain + one orchestrator + optional provisioning**.

### Quick picks by job‑to‑be‑done

- **Data & MLOps guardrails/evals:** Databricks Agent Bricks; Dataiku; Snowflake Cortex Agents; **Observe (o11y.ai)**.  
- **Security automation:** **Snyk** · *(complement: runtime security tools)*.

### Capability trends vs. last edition
- **Diagnostics:** More **change‑aware correlation** and **hypothesis testing**; observability tools add **post‑mortem drafting** and **Slack/Teams updates** by default.  
- **Activities & history:** Richer **incident timelines** and **action replays** (e.g., "apply last good remediation"), strongest in orchestrators.  
- **Provisioning:** Clear split—some stay advisory; others (Azure Copilot, DuploCloud) execute with **diffs, approvals, rollbacks**.  
- **Event ontology:** Convergence on **OTel semantic conventions** and CMDB/entity graphs; better joins across **alerts ↔ services ↔ changes**.  
- **Agent observability:** First‑class **traces, evaluations, safety scores** (Foundry, Dataiku, Databricks, Salesforce Command Center).

### Reference architecture (what "good" looks like)

1. **Telemetry backbone:** OTel + your observability suite (Dynatrace/Splunk/Datadog/Elastic/New Relic).  
2. **Orchestration & audit:** ServiceNow or Salesforce; add **PagerDuty AIOps** for real‑time response.  
3. **Provisioning lane:** **Azure Copilot (Agent Mode)** or DuploCloud for controlled applies; Qovery for migration IaC.  
4. **Developer loop:** GitHub Copilot Coding Agent / Atlassian Rovo Dev / Zencoder; JFrog Fly for release policy.  
5. **AgentOps layer:** Azure AI Agent Service (Foundry), Dataiku, or Databricks for **tracing, evals, safety**.  
6. **Guardrails:** RBAC, approval workflows, drift checks, **read‑only dry‑runs by default**, and **immutable audit logs**.

### Risks & guardrails to enforce
- **False confidence / silent failures:** Require **evidence links** for every diagnosis; block "summary‑only" outputs.  
- **Unsafe changes:** Enforce **two‑person approval** and **automatic rollback plans**; prefer **IaC diffs** over ad‑hoc commands.  
- **Vendor lock‑in:** Favor platforms with **MCP/A2A**, exportable traces, and **open schemas**.  
- **Cost surprises:** Track **agent run counts, tool invocations, LLM usage**; set SLOs & budgets for agents.

### Bake‑off checklist (pair with Atlas KPIs)
- **TTFC/TTRC** on a fixed incident set, with **linked evidence** and a **verification plan** per RCA.  
- **Actionability rate:** % of cases with a safe next step (rollback/fix or runbook).  
- **Closed‑loop rate:** % of incidents where the platform **proposed and executed** a remediation under approvals.  
- **AgentOps quality:** Presence of **traces/evals/guardrails**, red‑team tests, **data boundary controls**.  
- **Interoperability:** MCP/OTel support; **OTel→CMDB** mapping if you use an orchestrator.

# 🗂️ Platform Archetypes Overview

### 🔭 Observability‑First Agents
These agents spring from APM, monitoring, and logging platforms. **Dynatrace's Davis AI** and **Cisco's (Splunk) AI Agents** are prime examples. They have **high diagnostic capabilities** – ingesting huge volumes of telemetry, detecting anomalies, performing root cause analysis (often with causal AI), and even initiating automated remediation of known issues. They boast strong event ontologies (Dynatrace's unified entity model, Splunk's CIM with OpenTelemetry data) and rich observability dashboards. However, they intentionally do not focus on provisioning or large-scale changes – any fixes applied are usually within the existing infrastructure (restarting services, adjusting thresholds, etc.), not deploying new servers or altering network architecture. The value here is in proactive incident detection and resolution guidance, not infrastructure as code.

**Additions:** **Datadog Bits AI & AI Agents** (SRE/Dev/Sec agents, hypothesis‑driven RCA, incident comms, post‑mortems), **Elastic AI Assistant for Observability** (ESRE‑grounded answers, runbook proposals), **New Relic AI** (plain‑English NRQL, change‑aware analysis), **BigPanda Event Intelligence**, **BMC Helix AIOps**, **LogicMonitor AIOps**, **Moogsoft**.

### ⚙️ Provisioning‑Focused Agents
These platforms excel at automating environment setup and resource management. **DuploCloud's AI DevOps Suite** and **Qovery's AI Migration Agent** fall in this bucket. They typically integrate with cloud APIs or use Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes) under the hood to provision and configure systems on demand. For example, DuploCloud's agent can create cloud resources and pipelines based on high-level requests (backed by Terraform), and Qovery's open-source agent can generate Terraform files or Dockerfiles to help migrate applications to cloud platforms. **Kuberns Platform**, a managed PaaS with an AI assistant, also emphasizes one-click deployment and AI-driven scaling/cost optimization. These agents handle provisioning as a core strength, automating tasks like spinning up VMs, containers, or cloud services. On the flip side, their observability and diagnostics features are limited – they might perform basic health checks or cost analyses, but they don't have full AIOps event correlation. In short, they'll launch or fix your infrastructure components, but they rely on other tools to deeply monitor them.

**Additions:** **Microsoft Azure Copilot (Agent Mode)**—VS Code operator that decomposes requests, generates/modifies Bicep, runs `az`/`azd`, checks resource health, deploys under RBAC with confirmation gates, **HashiCorp Terraform MCP + Infragraph**.

### 👨‍💻 Developer‑Centric (Code‑First) Agents
This category targets software engineers and integrates into the development lifecycle. **AWS Strands SDK**, **Atlassian's Rovo Dev Agent**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Zencoder AI Agents**, and **JFrog's Fly** all exemplify a developer-first approach. They often run as part of the coding process or CI/CD pipeline. For instance, Atlassian's Rovo Dev is a CLI tool that can generate code, write tests, and even create pull requests autonomously to accelerate development. GitHub's evolving AI agent can propose code changes via pull requests while respecting branch protections (acting as an asynchronous coding assistant). Zencoder's agents embed in CI to fix failing tests, update documentation, and suggest code refactors automatically when pipelines fail. JFrog Fly introduces an "agentic" repository that works with AI agents to manage artifact releases and security compliance in the dev workflow. These tools usually require some configuration or code (they might be SDKs or CLI commands), and they operate by producing code or config changes rather than by controlling running infrastructure directly. Their "activities" logging is often via source control history or CI logs, and their observability is minimal outside developer metrics (like code quality or build status). In essence, they act as AI co-developers more than traditional ops bots.

**Additions:** **Microsoft Azure AI Agent Service (Foundry)**—enterprise framework for building and observing multi‑agent systems; MCP/OpenAPI tools; AgentOps/OTel tracing; open‑source Agent Framework SDK, **GitLab Duo Agent Platform**.

### 🏢 Enterprise Workflow Orchestrators
These are the heavyweights leveraging existing enterprise platforms. **ServiceNow AI Agent Orchestrator** and **Salesforce OpsAI/Agentforce** are key examples, and even **IBM's AskIAM** (built on Watsonx) fits here for a specialized domain. They provide a low-code interface to orchestrate complex workflows across IT and business operations. ServiceNow's platform can ingest activity records from across the enterprise (tickets, configuration database, monitoring alerts) and use AI agents to triage incidents, correlate events, and even execute runbook actions via its workflow engine. Salesforce's Agentforce (also branded as OpsAI for IT ops use-case) integrates with its Data Cloud and Atlas AI to monitor events (like incidents, cases) and can trigger actions through Salesforce Flow or external integrations. These platforms tend to have a high event ontology – for example, Salesforce defines an incident object model and topics for events, and ServiceNow has its Common Service Data Model – which helps their agents understand context at a high level. They can perform diagnostics (e.g., identifying an alert's likely root cause, using knowledge base or past incidents) and even some provisioning or remediation by invoking other tools (resetting a server via integration, creating a Jira ticket, running an Apex script, etc.). However, their direct observability into infrastructure is partial; they often rely on integrations with monitoring tools for deep metrics. The strength here is coordination and breadth: an agent orchestrator can call on many specialized agents or workflows to resolve an incident end-to-end. These systems are poised to be the "brain" that delegates tasks out to more focused tools.

**Additions:** **PagerDuty AIOps**—noise reduction & correlation, AI agent suite drafting comms and next steps, change‑aware hints; safe diagnostics/remediations via Automation Actions/Rundeck, **Rootly**, **xMatters**, **Kubiya**.

### 📊 Data and MLOps Agents
A subset of platforms concentrate on data pipelines, ML model lifecycle, and AI quality management. **Databricks' Agent Bricks**, **Snowflake's AI Agents**, and **Dataiku AI Agents** represent this group. They are not traditional IT ops tools but bring agentic AI to data science and analytics operations. For example, Databricks Agent Bricks can simulate agents in notebooks to evaluate LLM behaviors or automatically judge the quality of model outputs (it focuses on AI evaluation and guardrails, using synthetic data and MLflow tracking). Snowflake's approach involves using its Data Cloud to let agents automate parts of the data science workflow – e.g. preparing datasets, scheduling training runs, or detecting data drift – all within the Snowflake ecosystem (with a strong event model of pipeline steps and metrics). Dataiku's AI Agents feature allows creation of governed agents that can orchestrate data projects, with a "trace explorer" to debug agent decisions and built-in guardrails. These data-focused agents have rich domain-specific ontologies (for pipelines, models, datasets) and good observability into model performance and costs. They typically don't provision infrastructure outside their platform – for instance, they won't create new Kubernetes clusters for you, but they might allocate resources in Databricks or trigger a cloud function as part of a data workflow. Their diagnostics are about data and model issues (accuracy, drift, etc.) rather than IT incidents.

**Additions:** **Observe (o11y.ai)**.

### 🎯 Specialized Domain Agents
Some AI agents zero in on a narrow yet critical domain of IT. **IBM's AskIAM** is a prime example, concentrating on Identity and Access Management tasks. Built with Watsonx Assistant, AskIAM can handle requests like provisioning or deprovisioning user access, checking compliance with access policies, and answering audit queries. It maintains activity records of access changes and can diagnose potential identity risks (like toxic permission combinations) using AI. Another example is **JFrog's security and compliance agents** (part of JFrog Fly's ecosystem), which automatically scan for vulnerabilities and even initiate remediation by suggesting or applying artifact updates. **Kagent by Solo.io** targets Kubernetes operations specifically – it runs AI agents inside K8s clusters to troubleshoot and fix issues at the cluster level (e.g., analyzing pod logs, adjusting deployments) and uses an open standard (MCP, or Model Context Protocol) to interface with various tools. These domain-specific agents leverage AI to handle repetitive, domain-specific chores with high accuracy, but by design they are limited in scope – they won't manage anything outside their niche.

**Additions:** **Snyk**, **incident.io**, **Overmind**, **Harness AIDA**, **Dell APEX AIOps**.
