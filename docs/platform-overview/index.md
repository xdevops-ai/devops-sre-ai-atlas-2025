# Platform Overview

This page provides a one-page snapshot of all AI platforms featured in the atlas. Use this overview to quickly scan all vendors and understand their focus. See the [Platform Directory]({{ '/platforms/' | relative_url }}) for detailed analyses and scoring.

## Neutral one-line summaries (A–Z)

- **[Atlassian Rovo Dev]({{ '/platforms/atlassian-rovo-dev' | relative_url }})** — Developer-centric coding/PR automation that links Jira↔Docs↔Code; infrastructure ops are out of scope.
- **[AWS Strands SDK]({{ '/platforms/aws-strands-sdk' | relative_url }})** — Code-first agent framework to plan/act with tools on AWS with OTel traces; bring your own knowledge layer.
- **[Cisco Splunk AI Agents]({{ '/platforms/cisco-splunk-ai-agents' | relative_url }})** — Agents embedded in Splunk for telemetry, anomaly/RCA, and playbook-driven remediation across Cisco/Splunk ecosystem.
- **[Databricks Agent Bricks]({{ '/platforms/databricks-agent-bricks' | relative_url }})** — Lakehouse-native agent evaluation and guardrails with MLflow traces; not intended for infra ops.
- **[Datadog Bits AI & Agents]({{ '/platforms/datadog-bits-ai' | relative_url }})** — Hypothesis-driven triage/RCA and incident comms over unified Datadog telemetry; can suggest runbooks/PRs.
- **[Dataiku AI Agents]({{ '/platforms/dataiku-ai-agents' | relative_url }})** — Governed agents for data workflows with Trace Explorer; strong tracing/guardrails, limited direct provisioning.
- **[DuploCloud AI Help Desk]({{ '/platforms/duplocloud-ai-help-desk' | relative_url }})** — Ticket-driven DevOps agents with Terraform-backed provisioning and rollback in the DuploCloud context.
- **[Dynatrace Davis AI]({{ '/platforms/dynatrace-davis-ai' | relative_url }})** — Causal correlation/RCA over full-stack telemetry, producing “Davis problems” with evidence; remediation via workflows.
- **[Elastic AI Assistant]({{ '/platforms/elastic-ai-assistant' | relative_url }})** — ESRE-grounded explanations and query suggestions inside Elastic Observability with runbook proposals.
- **[GitHub Copilot Coding Agent]({{ '/platforms/github-copilot-coding-agent' | relative_url }})** — Async cloud agent that fixes code/tests and opens PRs; infrastructure changes are PR-only.
- **[Google Vertex AI Agent Builder]({{ '/platforms/google-vertex-agent-builder' | relative_url }})** — No-code/ADK for conversational and multi-agent apps with webhooks/GCP actions; ops via external services.
- **[IBM AskIAM]({{ '/platforms/ibm-askiam' | relative_url }})** — IAM-focused assistant for requests/approvals and cross-system provisioning; limited deep infra observability.
- **[JFrog Fly (Agentic Repository)]({{ '/platforms/jfrog-fly-agentic-repo' | relative_url }})** — Agent-aware artifact/release governance with policy/evidence events; not a runtime ops console.
- **[Kagent (Solo.io)]({{ '/platforms/soloio-kagent' | relative_url }})** — Kubernetes-native agents orchestrating K8s/Prom/Grafana/Helm/Argo for diagnostics and guarded actions.
- **[Kuberns Platform]({{ '/platforms/kuberns-platform' | relative_url }})** — Managed PaaS with AI-assisted deployment/ops; third-party validation is currently limited.
- **[Microsoft Azure AI Agent Service (Foundry)]({{ '/platforms/azure-ai-agent-service-foundry' | relative_url }})** — Enterprise service to build/orchestrate multi-agent workflows with AgentOps and Logic Apps tools.
- **[Microsoft Azure Copilot (Agent Mode)]({{ '/platforms/azure-copilot-agent-mode' | relative_url }})** — VS Code operator that generates/edits Bicep and runs Azure CLI under RBAC with explicit confirmations.
- **[New Relic AI]({{ '/platforms/new-relic-ai' | relative_url }})** — Natural-language telemetry queries, NRQL generation, and change-aware analysis; advisory only (no direct apply).
- **[Opsera Hummingbird (Unified Insights)]({{ '/platforms/opsera-hummingbird' | relative_url }})** — Unified DevOps insights/DORA metrics with recommendations; actions routed via integrations.
- **[PagerDuty AIOps]({{ '/platforms/pagerduty-aiops' | relative_url }})** — Incident intelligence for noise reduction, correlation, comms drafts, and safe diagnostics/remediations via Automation Actions/Rundeck.
- **[Qovery AI Migration Agent]({{ '/platforms/qovery-migration-agent' | relative_url }})** — Scans apps and outputs Terraform/Dockerfiles for cloud migration; produces artifacts, not live changes.
- **[Salesforce Agentforce (OpsAI)]({{ '/platforms/salesforce-agentforce-opsai' | relative_url }})** — Data Cloud-backed agents for ops flows with actions via Flows/MuleSoft and Command Center observability.
- **[ServiceNow AI Agent Orchestrator]({{ '/platforms/servicenow-ai-agent-orchestrator' | relative_url }})** — Multi-agent workflows across ITSM/ITOM with CMDB/OTel mapping; provisioning through runbooks/integrations.
- **[Snowflake Cortex Agents]({{ '/platforms/snowflake-cortex-agents' | relative_url }})** — Data-centric agents orchestrating Analyst/Search with tools/LLMs; infrastructure AIOps out of scope.
- **[Termius — Gloria]({{ '/platforms/termius-gloria' | relative_url }})** — SSH-native assistant to run services/commands and manage Docker on hosts; early provisioning features.
- **[Zencoder AI Agents]({{ '/platforms/zencoder-ai-agents' | relative_url }})** — CI-centric autonomous code fixers that diagnose failing pipelines and open PRs.
