# Capability Framework

This framework explains the criteria used to evaluate and score each platform in the atlas. We assess vendors across six high-level capability areas.

## Diagnostics & Root Cause Analysis
The platform’s ability to ingest multi-signal telemetry, correlate events, and generate causal hypotheses with supporting evidence.

## Activities & History
Rich incident timelines, action histories, and the ability to replay or "apply last good remediation".

## Provisioning & Change
Support for generating and applying infrastructure changes under approvals and with rollback, typically via Infrastructure-as-Code.

## Orchestration & Audit
Workflow engines and approval chains that link tickets, changes, and CMDB entities across teams, with immutable audit logs.

## Developer & CI/CD
Capabilities around code generation, pull request fixing, build/test pipeline remediation, and SDLC integrations.

## AgentOps & Guardrails
Tools to observe and evaluate agents themselves – traces, evaluations, safety scores, data boundary policies, and prompt guardrails.

Use these categories as a lens when reviewing platforms in the [Platform Directory]({{ '/platforms/' | relative_url }}) and [Platform Overview]({{ '/platform-overview/' | relative_url }}).
