**Interoperability —** IAM APIs (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, SailPoint, and others).  
**Deployment model —** IBM-managed service for enterprise clients.  
**Notes —** Deep infrastructure telemetry is out of scope.

**UKM Snapshots:** 
ingest P/M, index P/M, retrieval Y/M, governance Y/M, overall medium  <br>
**Note:** Ingestion & Validation: P/M; Normalization & Enrichment: Y/M; A key value of AskIAM is centralizing and simplifying access workflows across fragmented IAM tools saviynt


**UAM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/M, index Y/M, retrieval Y/M, governance Y/M, overall medium  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest Y/M; Index Y/M; Retrieval Y/M; Governance Y/M; Overall medium


**UDM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/M, index Y/M, retrieval Y/M, governance Y/M, overall medium  <br>
**Note:** Policy Issue Detection: Y/M; Root Cause in Access Terms: Y/H


**UOM Snapshots:**   
ingest P/L, index P/L, retrieval P/L, governance P/L, overall low  <br>
**Note:** Instrumentation & Ingest: P/M; AskIAM focuses on identity and access data; Normalization & Enrichment: Y/M; All identity data is structured against an identity schema (users, roles, resources)


**UEOM Snapshots:**   
ingest P/M, index P/M, retrieval P/M, governance P/M, overall medium  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest P/M; Index P/M; Retrieval P/M; Governance P/M; Overall medium


**UPM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest Y/H; Index Y/H; Retrieval Y/H; Governance Y/H; Overall high
