# IBM AskIAM

Activities: Y/M | Diagnostics: Y/M | Provisioning: Y/H  
Event ontology: P/M | Observability: P/L | Confidence: Medium

Build style / interface — Low‑code assistant workflows delivered via IBM Consulting.  
What it actually does — Handles identity and access requests, approvals, and onboarding; provides posture insights and cross‑system provisioning across platforms.  
Data / telemetry — IAM request histories and audit trails.  
Interoperability — IAM APIs (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, SailPoint, and others).  
Deployment model — IBM-managed service for enterprise clients.  
Notes — Deep infrastructure telemetry is out of scope.
