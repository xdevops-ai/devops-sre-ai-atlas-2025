# Opsera Hummingbird

**Activities**: Y/M | **Diagnostics**: Y/M | **Provisioning**: P/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: P/M | **Observability**: Y/M | **Confidence**: Medium

**Build style / interface —** Low-code dashboards and unified insights.  
**What it actually does —** Aggregates CI/CD and SCM data to produce DORA and DevEx metrics; provides AI insights and recommendations.  
**Data / telemetry —** CI pipelines, source control events, release events; analytics on AI code assistant adoption.  
**Interoperability —** Connectors to integrate with CI/CD, SCM and other tools; actions triggered via integrations.  
**Deployment model —** SaaS.  
**Notes —** Does not perform provisioning directly; relies on integrations for infrastructure changes.
