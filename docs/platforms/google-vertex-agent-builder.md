# Google Vertex Agent Builder

Activities: P/L | Diagnostics: P/L | Provisioning: P/L  
Event ontology: P/L | Observability: Y/M | Confidence: Medium

Build style / interface — No‑code console (Dialogflow CX lineage) and Agent Design Kit (ADK).  
What it actually does — Enables multi‑agent conversational experiences and analytics; agents act via webhooks and Google Cloud services.  
Data / telemetry — Conversation analytics and evaluation results.  
Interoperability — Webhooks; Vertex AI Search; Agent Garden sample agents.  
Deployment model — Google Cloud.  
Notes — Infrastructure changes require external services; the Jules coding agent is a separate product.
