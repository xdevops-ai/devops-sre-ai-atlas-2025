# Google Vertex Agent Builder

**Activities**: P/L | **Diagnostics**: P/L | **Provisioning**: P/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: P/L | **Observability**: Y/M | **Confidence**: Medium

**Build style / interface —** No‑code console (Dialogflow CX lineage) and Agent Design Kit (ADK).  
**What it actually does —** Enables multi‑agent conversational experiences and analytics; agents act via webhooks and Google Cloud services.  
**Data / telemetry —** Conversation analytics and evaluation results.  
**Interoperability —** Webhooks; Vertex AI Search; Agent Garden sample agents.  
**Deployment model —** Google Cloud.  
**Notes —** Infrastructure changes require external services; the Jules coding agent is a separate product.

**UKM Snapshots:** 
ingest P/L, index P/L, retrieval P/M, governance P/M, overall medium  <br>
**Note:** Ingestion & Validation: N/L; Normalization & Enrichment: P/L


**UAM Snapshots:**   
ingest P/L, index P/L, retrieval P/L, governance P/L, overall low  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest P/L; Index P/L; Retrieval P/L; Governance P/L; Overall low


**UDM Snapshots:**   
ingest P/L, index P/L, retrieval P/L, governance P/L, overall low  <br>
**Note:** Based Troubleshooting: P/L; Knowledge Base Answers: P/L; One strength of Dialogflow (Gen App Builder) is integration with knowledge bases and FAQs


**UOM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/M, index Y/M, retrieval Y/M, governance Y/M, overall medium  <br>
**Note:** Instrumentation & Ingest: N/L; Google’s Gen App Builder (Dialogflow CX-based) doesn’t ingest telemetry data by default; Normalization & Enrichment: N/L; Out of the box, there’s no observability data to normalize


**UEOM Snapshots:**   
ingest P/L, index P/L, retrieval P/L, governance P/L, overall low  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest P/L; Index P/L; Retrieval P/L; Governance P/L; Overall low


**UPM Snapshots:**   
ingest P/L, index P/L, retrieval P/L, governance P/L, overall low  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest P/L; Index P/L; Retrieval P/L; Governance P/L; Overall low
