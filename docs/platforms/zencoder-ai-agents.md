# Zencoder AI Agents

**Activities**: Y/M | **Diagnostics**: Y/M | **Provisioning**: P/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: N/L | **Observability**: P/L | **Confidence**: Medium

**Build style / interface —** Code-first assistant that integrates with CI workflows; agents run via CI webhooks or CLI and appear as GitHub comments.  
**What it actually does —** Autonomous coding agents fix failing tests, patch vulnerabilities, add documentation and tests, and open pull requests; they help triage CI failures and suggest improvements across repositories.  
**Data / telemetry —** CI run data, issue trackers, and pull request dashboards; actions and results are captured for audits.  
**Interoperability —** Integrates with GitHub, Jira, Sentry, and CI/CD pipelines.  
**Deployment model —** SaaS with CLI; agents run within GitHub checks and as a local client for tests.  
**Notes —** PR-centric and focused on code quality and developer productivity rather than runtime infrastructure automation.
