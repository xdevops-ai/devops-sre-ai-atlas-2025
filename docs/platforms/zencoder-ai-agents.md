Event ontology: N/L · Observability: P/L · Confidence: Medium

Build style / interface: Code-first; agents run via CI webhook or CLI and appear as GitHub comments.

What it actually does: Autonomous coding agents fix failing tests, patch vulnerabilities, add docs/tests and open pull requests. Helps triage CI failures and suggests improvements across repos.

Data / telemetry: CI runs, issue trackers, and PR dashboards; actions and results captured for audits.

Interoperability: GitHub, Jira and Sentry; integrates with CI/CD pipelines.

Deployment model: SaaS + CLI (agent runs in GitHub checks and a local client for tests).

Notes: PR-centric; not a runtime infra automation tool; emphasises code quality and developer productivity.
