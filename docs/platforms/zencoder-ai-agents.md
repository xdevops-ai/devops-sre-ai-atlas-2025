Event ontology: N/L | Observability: P/L | Confidence: Medium

Build style / interface — Code-first assistant that integrates with CI workflows; agents run via CI webhooks or CLI and appear as GitHub comments.
What it actually does — Autonomous coding agents fix failing tests, patch vulnerabilities, add documentation and tests, and open pull requests; they help triage CI failures and suggest improvements across repositories.
Data / telemetry — CI run data, issue trackers, and pull request dashboards; actions and results are captured for audits.
Interoperability — Integrates with GitHub, Jira, Sentry, and CI/CD pipelines.
Deployment model — SaaS with CLI; agents run within GitHub checks and as a local client for tests.
Notes — PR-centric and focused on code quality and developer productivity rather than runtime infrastructure automation.
