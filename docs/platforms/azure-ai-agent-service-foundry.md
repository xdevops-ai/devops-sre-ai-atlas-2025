# Azure AI Agent Service Foundry

**Activities**: Y/M | **Diagnostics**: N/L | **Provisioning**: P/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: P/M | **Observability**: Y/M | **Confidence**: Medium‑High

**Build style / interface —** Azure AI Foundry service and open‑source Agent Framework SDK, with a visual workflow editor and CLI.  
**What it actually does —** Provides an enterprise framework to build, deploy and manage multi‑agent systems with guardrails; orchestrates stateful agent workflows; integrates tools via OpenAPI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP); supports evaluation and AgentOps monitoring.  
**Data / telemetry —** Agent conversation logs, tool invocations, OpenTelemetry traces, governance events and metrics.  
**Interoperability —** Over 1 400 Azure Logic Apps as tools; supports external frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph; connectors to Microsoft 365 Copilot and other APIs.  
**Deployment model —** Runs as Azure AI Foundry in the cloud with a containerised agent runtime; the SDK is open‑source for local development and cloud deployment.  
**Notes —** Focused on agent workflow orchestration and governance rather than direct human‑facing operations.
