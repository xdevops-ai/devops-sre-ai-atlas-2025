Build style / interface — Azure AI Foundry service and open‑source Agent Framework SDK, with a visual workflow editor and CLI.
What it actually does — Provides an enterprise framework to build, deploy and manage multi‑agent systems with guardrails; orchestrates stateful agent workflows; integrates tools via OpenAPI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP); supports evaluation and AgentOps monitoring.
Data / telemetry — Agent conversation logs, tool invocations, OpenTelemetry traces, governance events and metrics.
Interoperability — Over 1,400 Azure Logic Apps as tools; supports external frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph; connectors to Microsoft 365 Copilot and other APIs.
Deployment model — Runs as Azure AI Foundry in the cloud with a containerised agent runtime; the SDK is open‑source for local development and cloud deployment.
Notes — Focused on agent workflow orchestration and governance rather than direct human‑facing operations.
