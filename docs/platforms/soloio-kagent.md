# Kagent (Solo.io)

**Activities**: Y/M | **Diagnostics**: Y/H | **Provisioning**: Y/M  <br>
**Event ontology**: P/M | **Observability**: Y/H | **Confidence**: High

**Build style / interface —** Kubernetes-native AI agent framework that orchestrates tools via an open Agent Gateway and MCP servers, with CRDs and the Gateway API.  
**What it actually does —** Orchestrates Prometheus, Grafana, Helm, Argo and other tools for cluster diagnostics, root cause analysis and safe changes. Collects agent and LLM traces along with Kubernetes and Prometheus data.  
**Data / telemetry —** Collects agent and LLM traces plus Kubernetes and Prometheus telemetry for diagnostics and analysis.  
**Interoperability —** Interfaces via MCP servers, custom resource definitions (CRDs) and the Gateway API; integrates with open-source and enterprise Kubernetes clusters and popular observability tools.  
**Deployment model —** Runs inside Kubernetes clusters; the open Agent Gateway is donated to the Linux Foundation with enterprise support available.  
**Notes —** Strong Kubernetes workflows, deep observability integrations and policy hooks; brings extensibility via CRDs and a pluggable gateway.
