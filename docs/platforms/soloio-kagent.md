# Kagent (Solo.io)

**Summary:** Kagent is a Kubernetes‑native AI agent framework from Solo.io. It uses an open Agent Gateway to orchestrate tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Helm, Argo, etc.) for cluster diagnostics, root‑cause analysis and safe changes. Activities: Y/M; Diagnostics: Y/H; Provisioning: Y/M; Event ontology: P/M; Observability: Y/H; Confidence: High. It runs inside K8s clusters (open‑source and enterprise versions), collecting agent and LLM traces plus K8s/Prom data, and interfaces via MCP servers, CRDs and the Gateway API. Strengths include deep K8s workflows and strong observability and policy hooks. Snapshot scores: UKM Medium‑High, UAM Medium‑High, UDM High, UOM High, UEOM Medium, UPM Medium‑High.

**Latest updates:** Solo.io donated its Agent Gateway to the Linux Foundation, added support for the latest MCP/A2A, and released Kagent Enterprise.
