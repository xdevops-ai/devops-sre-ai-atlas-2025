# Kagent (Solo.io)

Activities: Y/M | Diagnostics: Y/H | Provisioning: Y/M  
Event ontology: P/M | Observability: Y/H | Confidence: High

Build style / interface — Kubernetes-native AI agent framework that orchestrates tools via an open Agent Gateway and MCP servers, with CRDs and the Gateway API.  
What it actually does — Orchestrates Prometheus, Grafana, Helm, Argo and other tools for cluster diagnostics, root cause analysis and safe changes. Collects agent and LLM traces along with Kubernetes and Prometheus data.  
Data / telemetry — Collects agent and LLM traces plus Kubernetes and Prometheus telemetry for diagnostics and analysis.  
Interoperability — Interfaces via MCP servers, custom resource definitions (CRDs) and the Gateway API; integrates with open-source and enterprise Kubernetes clusters and popular observability tools.  
Deployment model — Runs inside Kubernetes clusters; the open Agent Gateway is donated to the Linux Foundation with enterprise support available.  
Notes — Strong Kubernetes workflows, deep observability integrations and policy hooks; brings extensibility via CRDs and a pluggable gateway.
