# Cisco Splunk AI Agents

**Activities**: Y/H | **Diagnostics**: Y/H | **Provisioning**: N/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: Y/H | **Observability**: Y/H | **Confidence**: High

**Build style / interface —** Low-code actions in Splunk Observability and Security products.  
**What it actually does —** AI agents assist with telemetry collection, alert configuration, anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and provide fix recommendations.  
**Data / telemetry —** OpenTelemetry signals and Splunk Common Information Model (CIM).  
**Interoperability —** Broad ecosystem integrations across Cisco and Splunk products.  
**Deployment model —** Offered as part of Splunk Cloud and Splunk Observability Cloud.  
**Notes —** Focuses on remediation via playbooks and integrations rather than direct infrastructure apply.

**UKM Snapshots:** 
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/M, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest Y/H; Index Y/H; Retrieval Y/H; Governance Y/M; Overall high


**UAM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Capture & Sessionization: Y/H; Evidence Policy & Verification: Y/H; Cisco+Splunk’s agentic AI works under strict data policies


**UDM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Detection & Alerting: Y/H; Root Cause Analysis & Correlation: Y/H; This is a core strength


**UOM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Instrumentation & Ingest: Y/H; Cisco’s platform (integrated with Splunk) ingests a broad range of telemetry; Normalization & Enrichment: Y/H; Ingested data is normalized through Splunk’s Common Information Model, and Cis


**UEOM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest Y/H; Index Y/H; Retrieval Y/H; Governance Y/H; Overall high


**UPM Snapshots:**   
ingest N/L, index N/L, retrieval N/L, governance N/L, overall low  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest N/L; Index N/L; Retrieval N/L; Governance N/L; Overall low
