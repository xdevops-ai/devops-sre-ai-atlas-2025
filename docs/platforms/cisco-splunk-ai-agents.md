# Cisco Splunk AI Agents

**Activities**: Y/H | **Diagnostics**: Y/H | **Provisioning**: N/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: Y/H | **Observability**: Y/H | **Confidence**: High

**Build style / interface —** Low-code actions in Splunk Observability and Security products.  
**What it actually does —** AI agents assist with telemetry collection, alert configuration, anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and provide fix recommendations.  
**Data / telemetry —** OpenTelemetry signals and Splunk Common Information Model (CIM).  
**Interoperability —** Broad ecosystem integrations across Cisco and Splunk products.  
**Deployment model —** Offered as part of Splunk Cloud and Splunk Observability Cloud.  
**Notes —** Focuses on remediation via playbooks and integrations rather than direct infrastructure apply.
