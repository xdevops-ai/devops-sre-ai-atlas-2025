What it actually does — AI agents assist with telemetry collection, alert configuration, anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and provide fix recommendations.  
Data / telemetry — OpenTelemetry signals and Splunk Common Information Model (CIM).  
Interoperability — Broad ecosystem integrations across Cisco and Splunk products.
