# PagerDuty AIOps

Activities: Y/M | Diagnostics: Y/M | Provisioning: P/L  
Event ontology: P/M | Observability: P/L | Confidence: High

Build style / interface - SaaS incident management with low-code incident workflows, Automation Actions, and an AI-driven Command Console.
What it actually does - Provides incident intelligence and response automation: suppresses and deduplicates alerts, correlates related events into incidents, surfaces change context and similar past incidents, drafts status updates and post-mortems, and recommends next steps. Includes SRE, Insights and Shift agents to assist during response.
Data / telemetry - Ingests events from monitoring tools and change feeds, and maintains incident timelines and human response history.
Interoperability - Integrates with Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch, Jira, ServiceNow, Slack and Teams; remediation can run via Automation Actions or Rundeck.
Deployment model - PagerDuty Operations Cloud (SaaS).
Notes - Human-centric: can auto-execute safe diagnostics and remediations when confidence is high, but escalates to humans if uncertain.
