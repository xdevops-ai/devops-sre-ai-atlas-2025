# PagerDuty AIOps

Activities: Y/M | Diagnostics: Y/M | Provisioning: P/L  <br>
Event ontology: P/M | Observability: P/L | Confidence: High

**Build style / interface —** SaaS incident management with low-code incident workflows, Automation Actions, and an AI-driven Command Console.  
**What it actually does —** Provides incident intelligence and response automation: suppresses and deduplicates alerts, correlates related events into incidents, surfaces change context and similar past incidents, drafts status updates and post-mortems, and recommends next steps. Includes SRE, Insights and Shift agents to assist during response.  
**Data / telemetry —** Ingests events from monitoring tools and change feeds, and maintains incident timelines and human response history.  
**Interoperability —** Integrates with Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch, Jira, ServiceNow, Slack and Teams; remediation can run via Automation Actions or Rundeck.  
**Deployment model —** PagerDuty Operations Cloud (SaaS).  
**Notes —** Human-centric: can auto-execute safe diagnostics and remediations when confidence is high, but escalates to humans if uncertain.
