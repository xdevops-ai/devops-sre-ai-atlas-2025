# Snowflake Cortex Agents

**Summary:** Cortex Agents are low‑code AI assistants embedded in Snowflake’s Data Cloud. They orchestrate Cortex Analyst & Cortex Search to help with data pipeline and MLOps tasks. Activities: Y/M; Diagnostics & Provisioning: P/L; Event ontology: Y/H; Observability: P/L; Confidence: Medium. They run in Snowflake SaaS, use SQL/Python for customization, integrate via UDFs, stored procedures and REST, and log conversation & query history. This product is data‑centric — not a general DevOps platform — so diagnostics & provisioning scores are low. UKM/UAM ≈ Medium‑High; UDM/UOM/UPM ≈ Low‑Medium; UEOM ≈ High.

**Latest updates:** Data Cloud Summit 2025 announced new SQL functions for Cortex Analyst & Search and GA for multi‑agent workflows.
