# Termius — Gloria

Activities: P/M | Diagnostics: P/M | Provisioning: P/M  
Event ontology: N/L | Observability: P/M | Confidence: Medium

Build style / interface — SSH-native assistant integrated into the Termius client.  
What it actually does — Runs common commands or services over SSH and is adding capabilities like pulling and configuring containers; not a full AIOps suite but a focused assistant.  
Data / telemetry — Limited to session and command outcomes.  
Interoperability — Integration is SSH-first using Termius Cloud and remote hosts.  
Deployment model — Runs as part of the Termius client; requires Termius Cloud and host instances.  
Notes — Early roadmap; capabilities still evolving and reliant on SSH; bring your own context and policies.
