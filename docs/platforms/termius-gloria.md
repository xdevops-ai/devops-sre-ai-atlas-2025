**Build style / interface —** SSH-native assistant integrated into the Termius client.  
**What it actually does —** Runs common commands or services over SSH and is adding capabilities like pulling and configuring containers; not a full AIOps suite but a focused assistant.  
**Data / telemetry —** Limited to session and command outcomes.  
**Interoperability —** Integration is SSH-first using Termius Cloud and remote hosts.  
**Deployment model —** Runs as part of the Termius client; requires Termius Cloud and host instances.  
**Notes —** Early roadmap; capabilities still evolving and reliant on SSH; bring your own context and policies.
