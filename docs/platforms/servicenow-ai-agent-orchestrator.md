Activities: Y/H | Diagnostics: Y/H | Provisioning: Y/M  
Event ontology: Y/H | Observability: Y/M | Confidence: High

Build style / interface — No/low-code Agent Studio orchestrates across ITSM and ITOM.  
What it actually does — Coordinates multiple agents and incident workflows; runs runbooks and service requests; maps OpenTelemetry data into the CMDB via Service Graph.  
Data / telemetry — ITSM/CMDB/CSDM records, with OTel via Service Graph.  
Interoperability — Supports integrations, scripts, and OTel connectors.  
Deployment model — Available on the ServiceNow Cloud.  
Notes — Provisioning occurs through integrations and runbooks rather than direct apply.
