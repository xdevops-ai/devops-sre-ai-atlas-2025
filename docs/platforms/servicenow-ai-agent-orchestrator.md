# Servicenow AI Agent Orchestrator

**Activities**: Y/H | **Diagnostics**: Y/H | **Provisioning**: Y/M  <br>
**Event ontology**: Y/H | **Observability**: Y/M | **Confidence**: High

**Build style / interface —** No/low-code Agent Studio orchestrates across ITSM and ITOM.  
**What it actually does —** Coordinates multiple agents and incident workflows; runs runbooks and service requests; maps OpenTelemetry data into the CMDB via Service Graph.  
**Data / telemetry —** ITSM/CMDB/CSDM records, with OTel via Service Graph.  
**Interoperability —** Supports integrations, scripts, and OTel connectors.  
**Deployment model —** Available on the ServiceNow Cloud.  
**Notes —** Provisioning occurs through integrations and runbooks rather than direct apply.

**UKM Snapshots:**
