# Datadog Bits AI & AI Agents

Activities: Y/H | Diagnostics: Y/H | Provisioning: P/L  
Event ontology: Y/M | Observability: Y/H | Confidence: High

Build style / interface — Integrated into Datadog SaaS platform (no‑code UX in dashboards/incident console).  
What it actually does — Generative AIOps assistant + role‑specific agents (SRE/Dev/Sec). Investigates alerts/incidents with parallel, hypothesis‑driven RCA; groups related alerts; produces real‑time incident summaries & suggested next steps; drafts post‑mortems; Dev agent can open PRs.  
Data / telemetry — Datadog’s unified telemetry (metrics, logs, traces, events) + service topology & runbooks.  
Interoperability — Slack/Teams, PagerDuty/On‑Call, Jira/ServiceNow; GitHub for PR‑based fixes.  
Deployment model — Datadog SaaS (some agents LA/preview in 2025).  
Notes — Human‑in‑the‑loop with optional auto‑run of safe remediations; approvals for complex actions.
