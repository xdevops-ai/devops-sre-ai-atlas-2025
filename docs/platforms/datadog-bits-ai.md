# Datadog Bits AI & AI Agents

Activities: Y/H - Diagnostics: Y/H - Provisioning: P/L

Build style / interface — Integrated into Datadog SaaS platform (no code UX in dashboards/incident console).

What it actually does — Generative AIOps assistant + role-specific agents (SRE/Dev/Sec). Investigates alerts/incidents with parallel, hypothesis-driven RCA; groups related alerts; produces real-time incident summaries & suggested next steps; drafts post-mortems; Dev agent can open PRs.

Data / telemetry — Datadog's unified telemetry (metrics, logs, traces, events) + service topology & runbooks.

Interoperability — Slack/Teams, PagerDuty/On-Call, Jira/ServiceNow; GitHub for PR-based fixes.

Deployment model — Datadog SaaS (some agents LA/preview in 2025).

Notes — Human-in-the-loop with optional auto-run of safe remediations; approvals for complex actions.
