**Activities**: Y/H | **Diagnostics**: Y/H | **Provisioning**: N/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: Y/H | **Observability**: Y/H | **Confidence**: High

**Build style / interface —** Low-code workflows and Davis apps.  
**What it actually does —** Automatic anomaly detection and causal root cause analysis; correlates into "Davis problems" with evidence.  
**Data / telemetry —** Full-stack APM/Infrastructure/Logs/RUM in Grail; uses DQL.  
**Interoperability —** Integrations and workflows.  
**Deployment model —** Dynatrace SaaS.
