# Dynatrace Davis AI

**Activities**: Y/H | **Diagnostics**: Y/H | **Provisioning**: N/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: Y/H | **Observability**: Y/H | **Confidence**: High

**Build style / interface —** Low-code workflows and Davis apps.  
**What it actually does —** Automatic anomaly detection and causal root cause analysis; correlates into "Davis problems" with evidence.  
**Data / telemetry —** Full-stack APM/Infrastructure/Logs/RUM in Grail; uses DQL.  
**Interoperability —** Integrations and workflows.  
**Deployment model —** Dynatrace SaaS.  
**Notes —** Remediation guided or via workflows; direct infra apply is limited.

**UKM Snapshots:** 
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/M, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest Y/H; Index Y/H; Retrieval Y/H; Governance Y/M; Overall high


**UAM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest Y/H; Index Y/H; Retrieval Y/H; Governance Y/H; Overall high


**UDM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Continuous Detection & Smart Alerting: Y/H; Automatic Root Cause Analysis: Y/H; This is where Davis truly shines


**UOM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Instrumentation & Ingest: Y/H; Dynatrace’s OneAgent automatically instruments hosts, processes, containers, and applications; Normalization & Enrichment: Y/H; All telemetry is fed into Dynatrace’s unified Smartscape mode


**UEOM Snapshots:**   
ingest Y/H, index Y/H, retrieval Y/H, governance Y/H, overall high  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest Y/H; Index Y/H; Retrieval Y/H; Governance Y/H; Overall high


**UPM Snapshots:**   
ingest N/L, index N/L, retrieval N/L, governance N/L, overall low  <br>
**Note:** Coverage — Ingest N/L; Index N/L; Retrieval N/L; Governance N/L; Overall low
