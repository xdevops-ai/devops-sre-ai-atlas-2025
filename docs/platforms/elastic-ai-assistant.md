# Elastic AI Assistant

Activities: P/M | Diagnostics: P/M | Provisioning: N/L
Event ontology: P/M | Observability: Y/M | Confidence: Medium

Build style / interface — Integrated into Elastic Observability (Kibana) with contextual prompts and chat.
What it actually does — Explains errors and logs with actionable fixes, answers questions like "why is latency high?", recommends queries and visualizations, and surfaces runbooks with the option to execute them for known issues.
Data / telemetry — Elastic full-stack data (metrics, logs, traces, APM profiles) grounded via ESRE; can include your organization’s knowledge base via connectors and RAG.
Interoperability — Works with user-provided LLMs or Elastic Cloud LLM; supports content connectors and can trigger Elastic Actions or external workflows.
Deployment model — Runs on the Elastic Stack (self-hosted) or Elastic Cloud.
Notes — A human assistant that accelerates root-cause analysis and onboarding.
