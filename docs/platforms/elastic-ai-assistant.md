# Elastic AI Assistant

**Activities**: P/M | **Diagnostics**: P/M | **Provisioning**: N/L  <br>
**Event ontology**: P/M | **Observability**: Y/M | **Confidence**: Medium

**Build style / interface —** Integrated into Elastic Observability (Kibana) with contextual prompts and chat.  
**What it actually does —** Explains errors and logs with actionable fixes, answers questions like "why is latency high?", recommends queries and visualizations, and surfaces runbooks with the option to execute them for known issues.  
**Data / telemetry —** Elastic full-stack data (metrics, logs, traces, APM profiles) grounded via ESRE; can include your organization’s knowledge base via connectors and RAG.  
**Interoperability —** Works with user-provided LLMs or Elastic Cloud LLM; supports content connectors and can trigger Elastic Actions or external workflows.  
**Deployment model —** Runs on the Elastic Stack (self-hosted) or Elastic Cloud.  
**Notes —** A human assistant that accelerates root-cause analysis and onboarding.
