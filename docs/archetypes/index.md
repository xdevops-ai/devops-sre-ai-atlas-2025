# Platform Archetypes

Understand the major categories of DevOps & SRE AI platforms. Each archetype groups platforms by their primary focus and strengths.

## Observability-First
Platforms built around multi-signal correlation, causal hypothesis reasoning, and narrative incident updates to accelerate triage and root cause analysis. Examples: Dynatrace Davis AI; Cisco (Splunk) AI Agents; Datadog Bits AI & Agents; Elastic AI Assistant; New Relic AI.

## Provisioning-Focused
Tools that specialise in safe, repeatable infrastructure changes. They generate and apply Infrastructure-as-Code with built-in approvals and rollback. Examples: Azure Copilot (Agent Mode); DuploCloud; Qovery; Kuberns.

## Developer-Centric & Frameworks
Platforms and SDKs designed for code and pull request fixes, or to build your own agents. They emphasise planning, tool orchestration, CI/CD fixes, and agent frameworks. Examples: AWS Strands SDK; Atlassian Rovo Dev; GitHub Copilot Coding Agent; Zencoder AI Agents; JFrog Fly; Microsoft Azure AI Agent Service (Foundry).

## Enterprise Orchestrators
Cross-team workflow engines and ticket/change graph orchestrators with audit trails. They coordinate approvals and runbooks across ITSM/ITOM. Examples: ServiceNow AI Agent Orchestrator; Salesforce Agentforce (OpsAI); PagerDuty AIOps.

## Data & MLOps
Platforms focused on AI quality, data pipelines, evaluations, and guardrails rather than runtime operations. Examples: Databricks Agent Bricks; Snowflake Cortex Agents; Dataiku AI Agents.

## Specialized Domain
Niche agents with deep expertise for a specific domain. They offer high accuracy within a narrow scope. Examples: IBM AskIAM (IAM); Solo.io Kagent for Kubernetes; Termius â€” Gloria for SSH management.
